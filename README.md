# C3-lua
A Lua library for communicating with the ZKAccess C3 Access Control Panels.

This library intends to implement the same functionality as provided by the ZKAccess C3 PullSDK.

## Usage
```
local C3 = require("C3")

C3.connect("1.1.1.1")
print("SessionId: " .. C3.SessionId())
C3.disconnect()
```

## API

### connect
```
connect(host, port)
```

The method is used to connect a C3 device. This method must be called before any other method and initializes a C3 session. Returns true in case of a successful connection.

### disconnect
```
disconnect()
```

Disconnects from the C3 access panel and ends the session.

### getRTLog
```
getRTLog()
```

This method acquires the realtime event log generated by the access panel. It contains the door and/or alarm status of the equipment.
